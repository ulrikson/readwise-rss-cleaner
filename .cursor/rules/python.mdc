Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional programming approach (avoid OOP)
- Keep files short (under 200 lines)
- Methods should have at most 2 parameters (dyadic) unless absolutely necessary
- Methods should be short. They should do one thing and do it well. Preferably 2-5 lines per method. Avoid one-line methods that simply wrap other function calls.
- Avoid boolean parameters - they often indicate a method doing more than one thing
- Follow KISS and YAGNI principles - don't over-engineer
- Typing: Always use type hints (from typing import List, Dict, Any, etc.)
- Imports: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports with a blank line between groups
- Naming: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- Functions: Write pure functions when possible, with clear docstrings
- Error handling: Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions
- Formatting: 4-tab indentation, 120-character line length
- Prefer using rich library for console output with appropriate colors
